After we did 2 milestones separatedly, I merged the two files in one so all the options to chose from mathematical procedures
are in one racket file. math.rkt takes care of all the operations in one place. First definitions/implementations
of the functions and set to send to the handler. This would make it similar to switch statement in c program. 
All the procedures except graph plotting functions takes list as arguments. 

We have 2d graphs for sin, cos functions and one 3d graph for sin vs cos.

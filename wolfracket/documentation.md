### A Racket Mathematics and Graphing REST API

## driver.rkt
This file runs the application.

## server-handler.rkt
The server creates an instance with a couple pages.

| page name | purpose|
|-----------|----------|
| home | The application home page, this page will describe the project as well as have input fields to display it in action.|

## math.rkt

File has all the implementation of calculations. uses libraries-->
